### Google: "Don't be evil"
*'Don't be evil'* used to be Google's motto (it was replaced by *'Do the right thing'* in 2015) and was suggested by Paul Buchheit, the creator of Gmail, in the early 2000s.


### Apple: "Think different"
The first slogan of the Apple company was *'Byte into an Apple'* (Changing the 'i' into 'byte' for a pun), but *'Think different" (1997-2002)'*, introduced during Steve Jobs return to the company, is the most iconic of Apple's slogans.

### Microsoft: "Empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more"
Microsoft went from *'Where do you want to go today?' (1994-2002)* to *'Empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.' (2013-present)*, a very corporate and unpersonal slogan.

### Amazon: "Work hard. Have fun. Make history."
A simple, efficient and universal tagline. Hasn't changed since.

### Facebook: "Move fast and break things"
Facebook’s inital slogan was *'Move Fast and Break Things'* and switched in 2022 to *'Move Fast with Stable Infrastructure'*.

### Tesla: "to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible"
I could't find the motto of Tesla so I visited to Elon's Musk official website ([you can find it here](https://www.tesla.com/blog/mission-tesla){:target="_blank" class="link"}) where it's stated that Tesla's mission is: *'to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible'*.

### X (ex-Twitter): "Blaze Your Glory!"
Before the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk in 2022, the blue bird company tagline was: *'What's happening?'* and has changed to *'Blaze your glory'* since the rebranding. I see a bit of trolling here.

### Netflix: "See what's next"
Clear and concise. Adopted in 2016, stable since.

### Uber: "Make transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere, for everyone"
*'Everyone’s private driver'* in the early years. At one point, it transitioned to *'Get there with Uber'*. Since 2018, the tagline appears to be *'We ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion'*. Note that It's worth noting that 'uber' is a German word that translates to 'over' or 'on top of'.

### Airbnb: "Belong anywhere"
*'Belong anywhere'* is the current tagline of the Bed and Breakfast company the former ones *'Travel like a human'*, *'Book rooms with locals'* and *'Live there'*.
