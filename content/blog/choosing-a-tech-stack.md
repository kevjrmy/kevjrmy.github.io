## What is actually a stack ?

A stack, in the context of tech, is the combination of all software tools used together to build and run applications.

Just like you need different ingredients to make a cake, a stack uses different technologies to create a website or app. For example:

- Front-End: would be the decorations on the cake, it's what the user see.
- Back-End: would be the baking, it's the process.
- Database: would be the recipe book.
- Server and hosting: would be the kitchen, the physical place where it happens.

Put together, these parts make project complete and ready !

## What's the best stack ?

That's the million-dollar question. The ideal stack depends on the specific requirements of the project, the team's/personal expertise, and other factors. Be aware that it's very difficult to switch to another stack once the project has started, so it's better to take the necessary time to evaluate every aspect. Here are some important points to consider:

- Project Type: Some technologies are better suited for websites, while others are designed for mobile apps, desktop apps, and so on.
- Cost: Some stacks involve higher costs due to licenses or hosting (e.g., shared hosting vs. cloud hosting).
- Preferences: the dev team's familiarity and comfort with certain technologies has a big impact on productivity and the overall project's success.
- Scalability: the project's scale is also important to consider. Evaluate how well the stack can handle long-term growth and how it can scale up to accommodate more users and higher traffic.
- Maintenance and updates: as the project evolves over time and for security concerns it will need maintenance.
- Performance: nowadays, performance differences tend to diminish as technologies compete to offer the best results, it's still important to consider. Make comparisons and benchmarks.

These are the top key points to consider, but there are other points to track as each project is different. Also, remember that simplicity is key to maintainability, so don't overcomplicate things unnecessarily.

## A place to start

A good starting point is to look at what others do. For this purpose there's a platform that's really helpful: [StackShare.io](https://stackshare.io/){:target="_blank"}. One great thing it does is allow you to search which stacks are being used by whom.

Let's have a look at BBVA's stack, a well established international bank. What can we see ?

What emerges from it is that it's very classical: it uses Java/Scala for logic (typical for a banking company) and Microsoft Azure for the cloud (also typical for a large company like BBVA).
I would describe this stack as classical, traditional, and old-fashioned, yet simple and efficient.

Now let's take a another look, this time at Glovo

We can note that Glovo is using a much more modern and trendy technologies than BBVA, such as Vue (a JavaScript framework) for their user interface, AWS (Amazon Web Services) for their cloud infrastructure, including Amazon S3 for storage, and Cloudinary for cloud-based image management. From this data, we can conclude that they rely on a strategy that emphasizes a modern approach with recent frameworks and microservices.

In conclusion, it's no surprise to see both stack strategies match their identity (classical for BBVA and modern for Glovo).

## In a nutshell

```
My secret formula: S = INÂ²
ðŸ‘‰ Stack = (identity * necessity)scalability
```

More seriously, it's obviously more complicated than that, but you get the picture. Just keep in mind that a stack depends on a mix of objective criterias as well as some subjective ones. Hence why it's hard to give a straight answer. It's up to you to *Know Thyself* and your project to make the right choice.

So take your time you time (but beware of taking too much time).

Hope it helped and see you soon.
